Flash armbian system onto microSD, remember to resize the root partition, otherwise, it's too small (3.1G). I had to delete the partition on the RPI, recreate a larger partition starting from exact same position, then resize it on desktop debian system (fsck is absolutely required, and won't run on mounted system, and then you cannot umount /) via first running fsck -f on the partition, and then resize2fs. Now it's 15 Gb.

*installing the prequisites for coherentsdr

First, cmake is needed for compiling most of the required libraries. This is easy on Armbian with apt-get
		apt-get install cmake

1. Experimental rtl-sdr fork
	Get libusb developer libraries (needs root or sudo):
		apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
	Download the source:
		git clone git://github.com/tejeez/rtl-sdr
		cd rtl-sdr
		mkdir build
		cmake .. -DDETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER=ON -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
		make -j 4
		make install
		
		ldconfig
		sudo udevadm control -R
		sudo udevadm trigger

2. Compile Vector Optimized Library of Kernels (VOLK) from sources
	install Mako templates for python
		apt-get install python-mako
	install Boost-C++ libraries. note, the available version may vary, for me 1.58 worked. to check, run:  sudo apt-cache search libboost
		apt-get install libboost1.58-all

	Download the source:
		git clone git://github.com/gnuradio/volk
		cd volk
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make -j 4
		make install

3. Install Fastest Fourier Transform in The West (FFTW), easy
		apt-get install fftw3-dev

4. Install ZMQ libraries
		apt-get install libzmq3-dev

5. Compiling coherentsdr.cc
		gcc coherentsdr.cc -lzmq -lpthread -lfftw3f -lvolk -lstdc++ -lrtlsdr -lm -o coherentsdr
