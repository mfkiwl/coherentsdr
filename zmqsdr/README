This folder contains the matlab ZMQ interface. Files:

	CSDRZMQ.m : the matlab system object class that acts as a wrapper for the C++ MEX implementation
	zmqsdr.cc : ZMQ client implementation.

Command to build the client: mex zmqsdr.cc -lzmq

Move the build product (i.e. zmqsdr.mexa64) and CSDRZMQ.m to matlab path.

Usage in matlab:

	%instantiate object

	sdr=CZMQSDR('IPAddress','192.168.100.1','Port','5555','ControlPort','5556');

	%receiver loop:

	for n=1:100
		Y=sdr();
	end

	%send a command to retune the receiver to 865MHz:

	sdr.CenterFrequency = 865e6; % the message is actually sent during the next call to sdr().
	sdr();
